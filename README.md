## 🚀 About Me
I am a **Principal Software Engineer / Software Architect** focused on designing and implementing
**distributed systems**, **real-time IoT telemetry platforms**, and **high-throughput event pipelines**.

My work revolves around:
- Low-latency data streaming  
- High-scale ingestion pipelines (200–300 msg/s per topic, peaks > 7k msg/s)  
- Event-driven architectures (Kafka / Pulsar)  
- Domain modeling, clean architecture and DDD  
- Kubernetes-based ecosystems (EKS)  
- Observability, resilience and performance optimization  
- Engineering leadership & architecture governance  

I love transforming complex distributed problems into predictable, scalable and elegant systems.

## 🔧 Engineering Philosophy
> “Simple systems scale. Complex systems break.”

I believe that architecture is not about frameworks — it’s about **clarity, consistency and predictability**.

Strong engineering requires:
- Clear boundaries  
- Stable contracts  
- Explicit domain rules  
- Observability by default  
- Performance as a feature  
- Cost efficiency
